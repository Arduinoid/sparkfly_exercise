/*
Parallel Uniqueness Checker:
We have generated a number of CSV files containing
random strings that should be guaranteed to unique (e.g., X59J) within themselves and
among each other. Write code that can take the names of these files and verify the code
uniqueness across all CSV files in parallel. Bonus points if you can make it immediately
stop itself once it has found a duplicate code. Example CSV files can be found in the
attachments of this email.
